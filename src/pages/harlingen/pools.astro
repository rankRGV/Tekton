    question: "Does Harlingen have different pool permitting requirements than McAllen or Brownsville?",
    answer:
      "Harlingen is in Cameron County, which shares some requirements with Brownsville but has its own city permitting process. You need a building permit from the City of Harlingen, engineered plans, a site survey, and compliance with barrier (fencing) requirements. If your property is in a FEMA flood zone — and parts of Harlingen near Arroyo Colorado are — you will also need floodplain approval. We handle every permit and inspection.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the water table high enough in Harlingen to affect pool construction?",
    answer:
      "In some areas, yes. Properties closer to the Arroyo Colorado or in lower-elevation sections of Harlingen can have a water table that affects excavation and shell installation. We test soil and water conditions on your lot before design and engineer the pool shell with hydrostatic relief valves and proper drainage to prevent floating or cracking.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many months per year can you realistically use a pool in Harlingen?",
    answer:
      "Harlingen's mid-Valley climate gives you comfortable pool weather from March through November — roughly 9 months. Add a heat pump, which we install as part of the build, and you can swim year-round. With average highs in the 80s and 90s for most of the year, a pool in Harlingen gets more use than almost anywhere else in Texas.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build a pool in the newer subdivisions off Ed Carey Drive?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. The newer developments along Ed Carey Drive and Loop 499 typically have the lot sizes, soil conditions, and utility access that make pool construction straightforward. We verify setback requirements and HOA restrictions (if any) during the design phase so there are no surprises once construction begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build pools with outdoor kitchens and covered patios as one project?",
    answer:
      "Yes — and that is the smartest way to do it. Building your pool, outdoor kitchen, and patio cover as a single project means shared excavation, coordinated drainage, unified electrical and gas runs, and one permit process. It costs less than doing them separately and avoids tearing up finished work later.",

            Harlingen Backyards Were Made for Pools
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            With nine months of swim weather and some of the most generous lot sizes in the mid-Valley, Harlingen is one of the best cities in the RGV for a backyard pool. Whether you are in an established neighborhood near Dixieland with a mature yard and shade trees, or in a newer subdivision off Ed Carey Drive with a blank canvas to work with, the conditions here are ideal for year-round outdoor living.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Harlingen pool construction does require attention to local soil and drainage. Parts of the city near the Arroyo Colorado have higher water tables and clay-heavy soils that demand proper engineering — hydrostatic relief valves, reinforced gunite shells, and drainage systems designed for flat terrain that does not move water on its own. We address all of this in the design phase so your pool performs for decades, not just the first few years.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            As a company that also builds custom homes and handles full remodels, we design your pool as part of your property — not in isolation. That means coordinated drainage, shared electrical runs, properly graded decking, and an outdoor space that works together instead of creating problems between the pool and your home's foundation.
