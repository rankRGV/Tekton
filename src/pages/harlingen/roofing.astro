    question: "Do older Harlingen homes near Dixieland need full roof replacements or just repairs?",
    answer:
      "Many homes in the Dixieland and Country Club areas were built in the 1950s through 1970s and have had multiple roof layers added over the decades. If your roof has two or more layers, Cameron County code requires a full tear-off before re-roofing. We inspect your roof for free, determine what is underneath, and give you an honest recommendation — repair if it makes sense, full replacement if it does not.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Harlingen require windstorm certification for roof replacements?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Harlingen is in Cameron County, which falls within the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) catastrophe area. Every roof replacement must meet wind-resistance standards and receive a WPI-8 certificate to qualify for windstorm insurance. We handle the entire certification process — engineering specs, installation, inspection scheduling, and final documentation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do Valley hailstorms affect Harlingen roofs differently than other RGV cities?",
    answer:
      "Harlingen sits in the mid-Valley corridor where severe thunderstorms often track northeast from the Gulf. The mix of older roofing stock near Dixieland and newer construction along Ed Carey Drive means hail damage varies widely. Older shingles crack and lose granules faster, while newer architectural shingles hold up better. We assess both damage types and help file insurance claims when the damage qualifies.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Tekton replace a roof near Valley International Airport with FAA height restrictions?",
    answer:
      "Properties near Valley International Airport may have zoning overlays that affect structures. Roof replacements typically do not change building height, so they are not affected — but if your project involves adding roof pitch or a second story, we verify compliance with FAA Part 77 surfaces before starting. We are familiar with Harlingen's airport-adjacent building codes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer free roof inspections in the Ed Carey Drive and Loop 499 areas?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we provide free roof inspections across all of Harlingen, from the historic neighborhoods near Dixieland to the newer developments along Ed Carey Drive and Loop 499. We document everything with photos, check for storm damage, ventilation issues, and material wear, and give you a straightforward assessment with no sales pressure.",

            Harlingen Roofs Span Five Decades of Construction
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Harlingen's housing stock tells the story of the mid-Valley's growth. Drive through the Dixieland neighborhood or the Country Club area and you will find solidly built homes from the 1950s and 1960s — good bones, but roofing systems that have been patched, layered, and pushed well past their intended lifespan. Head out toward Ed Carey Drive or the newer subdivisions off Loop 499 and the construction is modern, but many of those roofs were built to minimum code with builder-grade materials that underperform in serious weather.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Both ends of the spectrum need roofing that accounts for what Harlingen actually faces: hailstorms that track through the mid-Valley corridor, sustained winds during hurricane season, and Cameron County's year-round humidity that accelerates material degradation. We spec materials and installation methods based on your home's age, location, and exposure — not a one-size-fits-all approach.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            As a full home solutions company that also builds custom homes and handles remodels, we understand how your roof connects to your attic ventilation, insulation, and structural framing. That means your new roof does not just keep water out — it helps your home breathe properly and reduces the cooling load that drives up summer energy bills in Harlingen.
