    question: "How far is Tekton from Harlingen?",

  {
    question: "What unique challenges do Harlingen homes face?",
    answer:
      "Harlingen has a mix of older homes (some built in the 1950s–70s) and newer construction. Older homes often need full roof replacements, updated plumbing and electrical for remodels, and structural assessments before renovation. We have experience working with both eras of Valley construction.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle insurance claims for Harlingen storm damage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Harlingen and the mid-Valley get hit by the same hailstorms and hurricane-season weather as the rest of the RGV. We document damage, file claims, meet with your adjuster, and fight for the full payout. You focus on your family — we handle the rest.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build a pool in Harlingen?",
    answer:

            Harlingen sits at the crossroads of the Valley — centrally located between McAllen and Brownsville, with a mix of established neighborhoods near Dixieland and the Country Club, and newer growth along Ed Carey Drive and Loop 499. It's a city with deep roots and homes that reflect every era of Valley construction.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            That mix of old and new means Harlingen homeowners face a wide range of challenges. Older homes need roofs that have been baking in the sun for decades. Mid-century homes need kitchen and bathroom updates to match modern living. Newer builds need pools and outdoor spaces designed for the climate. We handle all of it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
