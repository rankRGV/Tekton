          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Harlingen sits at the crossroads of the Valley — centrally located between McAllen and Brownsville, with a mix of established neighborhoods near Dixieland and the Country Club, and newer growth along Ed Carey Drive and Loop 499. It's a city with deep roots and homes that reflect every era of Valley construction.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            That mix of old and new means Harlingen homeowners face a wide range of challenges. Older homes need roofs that have been baking in the sun for decades. Mid-century homes need kitchen and bathroom updates to match modern living. Newer builds need pools and outdoor spaces designed for the climate. We handle all of it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            We're headquartered in McAllen — about 35 minutes west on Expressway 83. Harlingen is a core part of our service area, and we've built strong relationships with homeowners throughout the mid-Valley. From storm damage roof replacements to custom pool builds to complete home renovations — Tekton is one call away.
