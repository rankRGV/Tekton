  {
    question: "What should I expect when remodeling a 1950s or 1960s home near Dixieland in Harlingen?",
    answer:
      "Homes in the Dixieland and Country Club areas are well-built but come with era-specific challenges: galvanized steel plumbing that is likely corroded, original electrical panels that cannot handle modern loads, single-pane windows, and floor plans designed around smaller, closed-off rooms. We assess the full scope before quoting — plumbing, electrical, structural, and moisture — so you know exactly what you are getting into before demolition starts.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Harlingen's humidity require special materials for kitchen and bathroom remodels?",
    answer:
      "Yes — Harlingen's mid-Valley humidity is high enough to damage standard materials in wet areas within a few years. We use moisture-resistant drywall (not standard greenboard) in bathrooms and kitchens, mold-resistant insulation, PVC or composite trim, and properly waterproofed tile installations with kerdi membrane systems. These materials cost slightly more upfront but last dramatically longer in Harlingen's climate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you convert a closed floor plan to open concept in an older Harlingen home?",
    answer:
      "In most cases, yes. Many older Harlingen homes have interior walls that appear structural but can be replaced with engineered beams to open the space. We evaluate the framing, identify true load-bearing walls, and design the beam system to support the structure while giving you the open kitchen-to-living layout most families want. This is one of our most requested upgrades in the older Harlingen neighborhoods.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a full kitchen remodel take in Harlingen?",
    answer:
      "A full kitchen remodel typically takes 4 to 8 weeks depending on scope. If we are moving plumbing or upgrading electrical — which is common in older Harlingen homes near Dixieland and the Country Club area — add time for Cameron County permits and inspections. We provide a realistic timeline at the start and communicate weekly throughout the project.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Tekton handle all permits for Harlingen remodeling projects?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We handle all City of Harlingen building permits and Cameron County inspections. Any project involving structural changes, electrical upgrades, or plumbing modifications requires permits, and we manage the entire process from application through final sign-off. You never have to visit the permit office or coordinate with inspectors.",

            Harlingen Homes — From Mid-Century Character to Modern Function
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Harlingen has a housing mix that few RGV cities can match. The Dixieland neighborhood and Country Club area are full of solid, character-rich homes from the 1950s through 1970s — real plaster walls, hardwood under the carpet, generous room sizes. But these homes also come with galvanized plumbing that is slowly failing, electrical systems that cannot handle modern appliances, and closed-off floor plans that do not fit how families actually live today.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            On the other end of the spectrum, newer homes along Ed Carey Drive and off Loop 499 are only 10 to 20 years old but were often built with builder-grade finishes that are already showing wear — laminate counters peeling, basic cabinets sagging, and cheap tile cracking in bathrooms where the humidity never fully dissipates. These homes need targeted upgrades more than full gut jobs.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            We handle both. For older Harlingen homes, we modernize the systems and layout while preserving the character. For newer homes, we replace the builder-grade components with materials that actually hold up in the mid-Valley climate. Because Tekton also builds custom homes, we bring structural knowledge to every remodel — we know what is behind your walls because we build walls for a living.
