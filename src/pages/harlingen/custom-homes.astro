    question: "What areas in Harlingen have available lots for custom home construction?",
    answer:
      "The strongest growth areas for custom home builds in Harlingen are along Ed Carey Drive heading toward San Benito, the developing subdivisions off Loop 499, and scattered infill lots throughout established neighborhoods. Some larger acreage parcels are also available on the outskirts toward La Feria. We evaluate any lot you are considering for soil conditions, flood zone status, utility access, and setback requirements before you commit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Harlingen require windstorm certification for new home construction?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Harlingen is in Cameron County, which falls within the TWIA catastrophe area. Every new home must meet Texas Windstorm Insurance Association standards for wind-rated construction — engineered roof-to-wall connections, impact-rated windows or shutters, and reinforced garage doors. We build to these standards from the foundation up and handle the WPI-8 certification so your home is fully insurable from day one.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a custom home in Harlingen?",
    answer:
      "Most custom homes in Harlingen take 8 to 14 months from breaking ground to move-in, depending on size and complexity. Permitting through the City of Harlingen typically takes 3 to 6 weeks. We provide a detailed construction schedule before you commit and keep you updated through every phase with regular progress reports.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there flood zone concerns for building in Harlingen?",
    answer:
      "Some areas of Harlingen — particularly properties near the Arroyo Colorado and in lower-lying sections of the city — fall within FEMA-designated flood zones. This does not prevent building, but it requires elevated foundations, specific drainage engineering, and compliance with floodplain regulations. We check FEMA maps for every lot before design begins and engineer accordingly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build a custom home on a lot I already own in Harlingen?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely — build-on-your-lot is one of our most popular services in Harlingen. We evaluate your lot for soil conditions, flood zone status, utility access, and setback requirements, then design a home that maximizes your property. Whether it is a half-acre lot off Loop 499 or an infill parcel in an established neighborhood, we work with what you have.",

            Build the Home Harlingen's Tract Builders Cannot Offer
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Harlingen is growing steadily, with new subdivisions appearing along Ed Carey Drive and Loop 499 every year. But most of that growth is production homes — the same five floor plans, the same builder-grade finishes, the same compromises. If you want a home designed around your family instead of a builder's profit margin, custom construction is the answer.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Building custom in Harlingen means accounting for Cameron County's specific requirements. Wind-rated structural connections for TWIA certification, foundations engineered for local soil conditions, drainage systems designed for flat mid-Valley terrain, and materials that withstand the humidity that quietly destroys homes built with cheap components. We handle all of this as part of our standard build process — it is not an upgrade or an add-on.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Harlingen's mid-Valley position gives you access to everything the region offers — Valley International Airport five minutes away, McAllen thirty-five minutes west, the coast under an hour east — with a cost of living and lot prices that remain more affordable than the upper Valley. Your custom home investment goes further here, and we make sure the construction quality matches the opportunity.
