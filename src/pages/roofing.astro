    question: "How long does a full roof replacement take?",
    answer:
      "Most residential roofs are replaced in a single day — 24 hours or less. We prep our materials in advance, arrive early, and get the job done fast so you're not living under a tarp for days. Larger or more complex roofs may take 2 days.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle insurance claims for storm damage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We work directly with your insurance company throughout the claims process. We'll document the damage, meet with your adjuster on-site, and make sure you get everything you're entitled to. You focus on your family — we handle the paperwork.",
  },
  {
    question: "What roofing materials do you offer?",
    answer:
      "We install asphalt shingles, metal roofing, tile (clay and concrete), and flat roof systems (TPO, modified bitumen). We'll help you pick the best material for your home, budget, and the South Texas climate. Every option comes with a manufacturer warranty.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does your price match guarantee cover?",
    answer:
      "Bring us any written estimate from a licensed, insured roofing contractor in the RGV for the same scope of work — we'll match it. We believe you shouldn't have to choose between quality and price. Same materials, same warranty, same professionalism — guaranteed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my roof needs repair or full replacement?",
    answer:
      "If your roof is under 15 years old with minor damage (a few missing shingles, a small leak), a repair usually makes sense. If it's 15+ years old, has widespread damage, or you're seeing granules in your gutters, it's time for a replacement. We'll inspect it for free and give you an honest recommendation — no pressure to replace if a repair will do.",

            Your Roof Protects Everything You've Built

          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            A damaged roof isn't just a cosmetic problem — it's a threat to your home, your family, and everything inside. Water damage, mold, structural rot — it all starts with a roof that's past its prime.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            At Tekton Home Solutions, we don't just patch problems. We solve them. Whether it's a full tear-off and replacement, storm damage repair, or a proactive inspection before hurricane season — we handle it with the urgency it deserves.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            And because we also build custom homes, pools, and remodels, we understand how your roof fits into the bigger picture. That's expertise most roofing-only companies simply don't have.
