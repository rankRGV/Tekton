    question: "What challenges come with remodeling older Brownsville homes near Central Blvd?",
    answer:
      "Many homes in historic downtown Brownsville and the Central Blvd area were built in the 1940s through 1960s. They often have outdated electrical panels, galvanized steel plumbing that's corroding, and load-bearing walls that limit open floor plans. We assess the full scope before quoting — no surprises behind the drywall — and bring these homes up to modern Cameron County code while preserving their character.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you use humidity-resistant materials for Brownsville remodels?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely — it's non-negotiable in Brownsville. We use moisture-resistant drywall in bathrooms and kitchens, mold-resistant insulation, PVC or composite trim instead of wood in high-humidity areas, and properly sealed tile installations. Brownsville's average humidity is significantly higher than inland cities, so standard materials fail faster here.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical kitchen remodel take in Brownsville?",
    answer:
      "A full kitchen remodel in Brownsville typically takes 4 to 8 weeks depending on scope. If we're moving plumbing or electrical — common in older Cameron County homes — add time for permits and inspections. We give you a realistic timeline upfront and keep you updated throughout the project.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you open up the floor plan in my older Brownsville home?",
    answer:
      "Usually, yes. Many older Brownsville homes have walls that appear structural but can be replaced with engineered beams. We evaluate your home's framing, determine which walls are load-bearing, and design an open layout that's structurally sound. This is one of the most-requested upgrades we do in the Central Blvd and downtown Brownsville areas.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Tekton handle permits for Brownsville remodeling projects?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we handle all City of Brownsville and Cameron County permits. For projects involving electrical, plumbing, or structural changes, permits are required and we manage the entire process including scheduling inspections. You never have to visit the permit office.",

            Brownsville Homes Deserve a Modern Upgrade
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Brownsville has some of the most character-rich homes in the Rio Grande Valley — from the historic bungalows near Central Blvd to mid-century ranch homes throughout older Cameron County neighborhoods. But decades of Gulf coast humidity, outdated plumbing, and cramped floor plans mean these homes need more than cosmetic fixes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            We specialize in bringing older Brownsville homes into the present without erasing what makes them worth keeping. That means opening up closed-off floor plans with engineered beams, replacing corroded galvanized plumbing with PEX, upgrading electrical panels to handle modern loads, and installing humidity-resistant materials that actually survive Brownsville's coastal climate.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            As a company that also builds custom homes from the ground up, we bring structural expertise to every remodel. We know what is behind your walls because we build walls for a living. That knowledge means fewer surprises, better solutions, and a remodel that lasts.
