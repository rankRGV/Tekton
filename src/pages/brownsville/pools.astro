    question: "Does Brownsville require special permits for pool construction near flood zones?",
    answer:
      "Yes — much of Brownsville falls within FEMA-designated flood zones due to its low elevation and Gulf proximity. Pool construction in these areas requires additional engineering, elevated equipment pads, and specific drainage plans approved by Cameron County. We handle all flood zone permitting and design your pool to comply with local floodplain regulations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Brownsville's coastal drainage affect pool construction?",
    answer:
      "Brownsville's flat terrain and high water table mean drainage is a serious consideration for any pool build. We engineer French drains and grading plans around every pool to prevent water from pooling against your home's foundation. Poor drainage is the number one cause of pool deck failure in coastal areas — we prevent it from the start.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my Brownsville pool year-round?",
    answer:
      "Brownsville has the warmest average temperatures in the RGV, so you can realistically swim 9 to 10 months per year. Add a heat pump — which we install as part of the build — and you can swim comfortably even in January. Very few places in Texas offer this kind of return on a pool investment.",
  },
  {
    question: "What Cameron County permits are needed to build a pool in Brownsville?",
    answer:
      "You need a building permit from the City of Brownsville, which requires engineered plans, a site survey, and approval from the floodplain administrator if your property is in a FEMA zone. You also need to meet barrier (fencing) requirements under city code. We handle every permit and inspection so you don't have to navigate the process alone.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you protect pool equipment from Brownsville's salt air?",
    answer:
      "Salt air corrodes standard pool equipment faster than inland locations. We install corrosion-resistant pumps, use stainless steel or coated hardware, and position equipment pads with proper drainage and ventilation. We also recommend variable-speed pumps that run more efficiently in Brownsville's year-round warm climate.",

            Brownsville Has the Best Pool Weather in Texas
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            With average highs above 80 degrees for nine months of the year, Brownsville offers more swim days than almost anywhere in the state. A backyard pool here is not a luxury — it is how you live. Weekend cookouts, after-school swims, and late-night soaks are part of daily life when the weather cooperates this much.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            But Brownsville pool construction demands respect for the local conditions. Many properties fall within FEMA flood zones, the water table is high, and the flat coastal terrain creates drainage challenges that inland builders never face. We engineer every Brownsville pool with proper drainage systems, elevated equipment pads, and reinforced gunite shells designed for this specific environment.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Because Tekton also builds custom homes and handles full remodels, we coordinate your pool with your property's drainage, electrical, and gas systems as one project. No conflicts between contractors. No finger-pointing. One team handling everything from design through your first swim.
