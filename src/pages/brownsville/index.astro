  {
    question: "Do you really serve Brownsville from McAllen?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Brownsville is about 60 minutes from our McAllen headquarters, and we have active crews working in Cameron County regularly. We don't charge extra for the drive — our pricing is the same across the entire RGV. Many Brownsville homeowners choose us specifically because the local options are limited for multi-service contractors.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Brownsville's coastal climate affect my home?",
    answer:
      "Brownsville's proximity to the Gulf means higher humidity, stronger hurricane-season winds, and salt air that accelerates corrosion on roofing materials, metal components, and outdoor structures. We use materials specifically rated for coastal conditions — wind-rated shingles, corrosion-resistant fasteners, and UV-stabilized products.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle hurricane damage repair in Brownsville?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Brownsville is more exposed to hurricane-force winds than inland Valley cities. We handle emergency roof tarping, full storm damage restoration, and insurance claim assistance. We document everything and fight for the full payout from your carrier.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build a pool in Brownsville's flood zones?",
    answer:
      "Parts of Brownsville are in FEMA flood zones, which affects pool placement, drainage, and permitting requirements. We evaluate your property's flood zone status during the design consultation and engineer the pool accordingly. We handle all Cameron County permitting.",
  },

            Brownsville is the largest city in Cameron County and one of the fastest-growing areas on the border. From the established neighborhoods near Palm Boulevard and Central Boulevard to the newer developments along Paredes Line Road and near SpaceX, homeowners here need contractors who understand the unique challenges of building and maintaining homes this close to the coast.

          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Brownsville's proximity to the Gulf means higher humidity, stronger hurricane-season winds, and salt air corrosion that accelerates wear on roofing materials and outdoor structures. We use materials and installation methods specifically rated for coastal conditions — because what works in San Antonio doesn't hold up in Brownsville.

            Whether you need a roof replaced after a storm, a pool built for year-round use, a home remodeled to match your vision, or a custom home built from the ground up — Tekton brings McAllen-headquartered reliability to Brownsville. One team, one timeline, one contractor who answers the phone.
