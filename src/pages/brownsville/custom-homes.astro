    question: "What wind-rating requirements apply to new homes in Brownsville?",
    answer:
      "Brownsville is in the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) territory, which means your new home must meet specific wind-resistance standards to qualify for windstorm insurance. This includes engineered roof-to-wall connections, impact-rated windows or shutters, and reinforced garage doors. We build every Brownsville home to meet or exceed TWIA requirements and handle the WPI-8 certification.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build a custom home near the SpaceX development in Brownsville?",
    answer:
      "Yes — the area along Paredes Line Rd and east Brownsville is seeing significant growth driven by SpaceX Starbase activity. We're building in these developing areas and are familiar with the zoning, lot requirements, and Cameron County permitting process for new construction. If you've purchased land or are looking at lots in this corridor, we can help.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle coastal construction requirements in Cameron County?",
    answer:
      "Cameron County's coastal location means additional engineering requirements — elevated foundations in flood zones, wind-rated structural connections, corrosion-resistant materials for salt air exposure, and proper drainage engineering for the flat coastal terrain. We design every Brownsville home with these requirements built in from day one, not as afterthoughts.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a custom home in Brownsville?",
    answer:
      "Most custom homes in Brownsville take 8 to 14 months from breaking ground to move-in, depending on size and complexity. Permitting in Cameron County typically takes 3 to 6 weeks. We provide a detailed construction schedule before you commit and keep you updated throughout every phase.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build on lots the homeowner already owns in Brownsville?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely — build-on-your-lot is one of our most popular options in Brownsville. We evaluate your lot for soil conditions, flood zone status, utility access, and setback requirements, then design a home that maximizes your property. If you're still shopping for land, we can also advise on what to look for.",

            Brownsville Is Growing — Build the Home You Want
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Between SpaceX driving development along the eastern corridor and new residential areas opening up off Paredes Line Rd, Brownsville is experiencing a construction boom. Land is available, prices are competitive compared to the upper Valley, and the opportunity to build exactly what you want on your own lot has never been better.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            But building in Brownsville is not like building inland. Cameron County's coastal location requires wind-rated structural connections to meet TWIA standards, engineered foundations that account for flood zone elevations, corrosion-resistant materials that withstand salt air, and drainage systems designed for flat coastal terrain. Cut corners on any of these and you will pay for it — in repairs, insurance problems, or both.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            We build homes from the ground up with every coastal requirement engineered in from the start. Your foundation, framing, roof, and finishes are all designed for Brownsville's specific conditions. That is the difference between a house that survives its first hurricane season and one that does not.
