    question: "What roofing materials resist salt air corrosion in Brownsville?",
    answer:
      "Brownsville's proximity to the Gulf means salt air accelerates corrosion on metal fasteners and flashing. We use stainless steel or hot-dipped galvanized fasteners, apply marine-grade sealants, and recommend standing seam metal roofing with Kynar finishes or high-quality architectural shingles rated for coastal environments. These systems are specifically chosen to handle Brownsville's salt-heavy humidity.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Tekton replace a roof in Brownsville during hurricane season?",
    answer:
      "Yes — and hurricane season is actually when we're busiest. We install wind-rated roofing systems that meet the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) requirements for Cameron County. Every roof we install in Brownsville comes with the WPI-8 certificate you need for windstorm insurance coverage.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Brownsville require windstorm inspections for new roofs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Brownsville is in a designated catastrophe area under the Texas Department of Insurance, which means your new roof must pass a windstorm inspection and receive a WPI-8 certificate. We handle the entire inspection process — scheduling, documentation, and certification — so your roof is insurable from day one.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Brownsville's higher humidity affect roof lifespan?",
    answer:
      "Brownsville averages over 75% relative humidity much of the year, which promotes algae and mold growth on roofing materials. We install algae-resistant shingles with copper-infused granules, ensure proper attic ventilation to reduce moisture buildup, and recommend periodic maintenance to keep your roof clean and functional for decades.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer free roof inspections in the Palm Blvd and Paredes Line Rd areas?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We provide free roof inspections throughout Brownsville — from Palm Blvd near the Resaca to the newer developments along Paredes Line Rd and everywhere in between. We document everything with photos and give you an honest assessment, whether you need a full replacement or just a minor repair.",

            Brownsville Roofs Face Gulf Coast Punishment
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            No city in the Rio Grande Valley takes more weather abuse than Brownsville. Sitting at the southern tip of Texas, just miles from the Gulf of Mexico, your roof faces hurricane-force winds, salt-laden humidity that corrodes standard materials, and UV exposure that breaks down cheap shingles in half their rated lifespan.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            That is why every roof we install in Brownsville uses hurricane-rated systems with reinforced decking, marine-grade fasteners, and wind-resistant underlayment. From homes near Palm Blvd along the Resaca to newer neighborhoods off Paredes Line Rd, we spec materials that handle the reality of Cameron County weather — not just what looks good on a spec sheet.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            As a full home solutions company that also builds custom homes and handles remodels, we understand how your roof connects to insulation, ventilation, and your home's structural envelope. That means better airflow, lower cooling costs, and a roof that actually lasts in Brownsville's coastal climate.
