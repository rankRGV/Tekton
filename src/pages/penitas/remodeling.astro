    question: "Do you actually send crews to Penitas for remodeling jobs?",
    answer:
      "Yes — Penitas and western Hidalgo County are part of our primary service area. We do not charge travel fees and we do not deprioritize your project because you are 20 minutes west of McAllen. Our crews work in Penitas, La Joya, Sullivan City, and Palmview regularly. You get the same quality, timeline, and attention as any project closer to the McAllen metro.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I know about remodeling newer construction homes in Penitas?",
    answer:
      "Many Penitas homes were built in the last 10 to 20 years during the area's residential growth. While newer, some were built to meet minimum code — builder-grade finishes, basic cabinetry, and standard layouts. Upgrading these homes is straightforward because the bones are solid. We focus on the finishes, layouts, and features that turn a builder-grade house into the home you actually want.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does caliche soil affect home additions in Penitas?",
    answer:
      "If your remodel involves an addition or extending the foundation, caliche soil in western Hidalgo County is a factor. Caliche is a hard calcium carbonate layer that requires specific excavation methods and foundation engineering. We assess soil conditions before quoting any project that involves ground work, so there are no surprises mid-project.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Tekton handle Hidalgo County permits for Penitas remodels?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we handle all Hidalgo County permits for projects involving structural, electrical, or plumbing changes. We manage the application, documentation, and inspection scheduling so you never have to visit the county offices or coordinate with inspectors yourself.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remodel my kitchen and bathroom at the same time?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely — and doing both at once is usually more efficient and cost-effective. We coordinate the plumbing, electrical, and finish work across both spaces so the trades overlap instead of making separate trips. Most combined kitchen and bathroom remodels in Penitas take 6 to 10 weeks depending on scope.",

            Penitas Homes Are Ready for an Upgrade
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Penitas has grown steadily over the past two decades as families have moved to western Hidalgo County for larger lots, newer homes, and a quieter community just 20 minutes from McAllen on Expressway 83. But much of that growth came with builder-grade construction — functional but generic kitchens, basic bathrooms, and layouts designed to hit a price point rather than fit how families actually live.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            The problem has never been a lack of demand for quality remodeling in Penitas. The problem has been finding a contractor willing to serve this area. Most remodeling companies cluster around McAllen and Edinburg, treating anything west of the expressway interchange as too far. Homeowners in Penitas, La Joya, Sullivan City, and Palmview end up waiting weeks for callbacks — if they get one at all.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Tekton treats western Hidalgo County as a priority, not a favor. We bring the same crews, the same materials, and the same project management to every Penitas remodel. And because we also build custom homes from the ground up, we bring structural knowledge to every renovation. We know what is behind your walls because we build walls for a living.
