  },
  {
    question: "Is it hard to find good contractors in western Hidalgo County?",

  },
  {

            Penitas and the surrounding communities in western Hidalgo County — La Joya, Sullivan City, Palmview — are growing. New homes are going up, families are putting down roots, and the demand for quality contractors has never been higher. But most builders focus on McAllen and Edinburg, leaving the western Valley underserved.

          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            We're changing that. Tekton actively serves Penitas and all of western Hidalgo County. We know the area, we know the soil conditions, and we know that homeowners here deserve the same quality of work as anyone in the McAllen metro — without the markup or the runaround.
          </p>

            Roof replacement, pool construction, home remodeling, or a custom build on your property — we bring our full team and full capabilities to Penitas. Same crew, same materials, same standards as every job we do.
