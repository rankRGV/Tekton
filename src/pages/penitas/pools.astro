  {
    question: "Is it hard to find a pool builder who will work in Penitas?",
    answer:
      "It has been — most pool builders in the Valley are based in McAllen or Mission and prioritize jobs closer to home. Tekton serves Penitas and the entire western Hidalgo County corridor as a primary service area. No travel surcharges, no delayed timelines because you are 20 minutes down Expressway 83. Your pool build gets the same priority as any McAllen project.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does caliche soil in Penitas affect pool construction?",
    answer:
      "Caliche is a calcium carbonate hardpan common in western Hidalgo County. It makes excavation more difficult and expensive if your builder is not prepared for it. We test soil conditions before quoting so the price reflects reality — no surprise change orders because we 'hit caliche.' Our crews have the right equipment to excavate through it efficiently.",
  },
  {
    question: "What Hidalgo County permits do I need for a pool in Penitas?",
    answer:
      "You need a building permit from Hidalgo County, which requires engineered pool plans, a site survey, and compliance with setback and barrier (fencing) requirements. We handle every permit, every inspection, and every piece of paperwork so you never have to visit the county offices.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I really use a pool year-round in Penitas?",
    answer:
      "The western Valley gets the same warm climate as the rest of the RGV — highs above 80 degrees for roughly nine months of the year. Add a heat pump, which we install as part of the build, and you can swim comfortably even in the cooler winter months. A pool in Penitas is not seasonal — it is a lifestyle upgrade you will use almost every day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build pools for the newer homes being built in western Hidalgo County?",
    answer:
      "Yes — and newer construction is actually ideal for pool builds. The lots tend to be larger, utility access is straightforward, and we can coordinate the pool design with the home's existing drainage and electrical systems. Many families moving to Penitas for the larger lots specifically want a pool as part of their property.",

            Penitas Has the Space and the Weather for a Pool
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            One of the biggest reasons families move to Penitas and western Hidalgo County is the space. Lots are larger, neighborhoods are quieter, and your backyard is actually big enough to build something meaningful. Combine that with the Valley's nine-plus months of warm weather, and a custom pool is not a luxury — it is the reason you have a backyard in the first place.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            The challenge has always been finding a builder who will treat a Penitas project with the same urgency as one in McAllen. Most pool companies are 20 minutes east on Expressway 83 and treat western Valley jobs as filler between their preferred projects. Tekton is different. We serve Penitas, La Joya, Sullivan City, and Palmview as primary markets because these communities are growing fast and homeowners here deserve quality construction — not leftovers.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            We also understand the soil. Caliche hardpan is common throughout western Hidalgo County and requires the right excavation equipment and engineering. Builders who do not plan for it end up hitting you with change orders mid-project. We test before we quote so your price reflects reality from day one.
