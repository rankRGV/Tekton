  {
    question: "Are there reliable roofing contractors that actually serve Penitas?",
    answer:
      "Most roofing companies in the Valley are based in McAllen or Edinburg and treat western Hidalgo County as an afterthought. Tekton actively serves Penitas, La Joya, Sullivan City, and Palmview. We don't charge travel fees, we show up on time, and we treat your project with the same priority as a McAllen job. Western Valley homeowners deserve contractors who actually want to be here.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Penitas's caliche soil affect my roof and foundation?",
    answer:
      "Caliche soil is common throughout western Hidalgo County. It expands and contracts with moisture changes, which can cause subtle foundation shifts that stress your roof structure over time — cracked flashing, lifted shingles, and broken seals around vents. We inspect for these signs during every roof evaluation and address the underlying movement, not just the surface symptoms.",
  },
  {
    question: "What Hidalgo County permits are needed for a roof replacement in Penitas?",
    answer:
      "Roof replacements in Penitas require a building permit through Hidalgo County. We handle the entire permit process — application, documentation, and inspection scheduling. You do not need to visit the county offices or coordinate anything. We pull the permit, do the work, and make sure it passes inspection.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer free roof inspections in western Hidalgo County?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we provide free roof inspections throughout Penitas and the surrounding western Valley communities including La Joya, Sullivan City, and Palmview. We document everything with photos and give you an honest assessment. If your roof has another five years in it, we will tell you that instead of pushing a replacement you do not need.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do Valley storms affect roofs in Penitas specifically?",
    answer:
      "Penitas sits in open western Hidalgo County terrain with fewer windbreaks than more developed areas closer to McAllen. That means storm winds hit roofs harder here. We install wind-rated underlayment, use proper nail patterns for high-wind zones, and reinforce ridge caps and edges — the areas most vulnerable to uplift during Valley thunderstorms and tropical weather.",

            Western Hidalgo County Deserves Better Roofing
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Penitas is a growing community in western Hidalgo County — about 20 minutes west of McAllen on Expressway 83. New residential development is bringing families to the area for affordable land and a quieter pace of life near La Joya, Sullivan City, and Palmview. But when it comes to finding a quality roofing contractor, most homeowners hit the same wall: nobody wants to drive out here.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            That changes with Tekton. We serve Penitas as a primary market because we see what others ignore — a community of homeowners who need and deserve the same quality of work available in McAllen or Edinburg. Our crews work on Penitas roofs regularly, and we understand the specific challenges here: caliche soil that shifts foundations and stresses roof structures, open terrain that exposes roofs to unbroken wind during storms, and newer construction that sometimes cuts corners on materials to hit price points.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            As a full home solutions company that also builds custom homes and handles remodels, we understand how your roof connects to your entire home system. Proper ventilation, insulation, and structural integrity all matter — especially in the Valley heat. We build roofs that perform, not just roofs that pass.
