  {
    question: "Can I build a custom home on my own lot in Penitas?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely — build-on-your-lot is one of our most popular options in Penitas and western Hidalgo County. Many homeowners here have purchased land specifically for the larger lot sizes available west of McAllen. We evaluate your lot for soil conditions, utility access, setbacks, and caliche depth, then design a home that maximizes your property.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does caliche soil in Penitas affect new home construction?",
    answer:
      "Caliche is a dense calcium carbonate layer found throughout western Hidalgo County. It affects foundation design, drainage, and excavation costs. Some builders treat it as an unexpected expense and hit you with change orders. We test your lot's soil before design begins and engineer the foundation specifically for your property's conditions. The price you agree to is the price you pay.",
  },
  {
    question: "What Hidalgo County permits are needed to build a home in Penitas?",
    answer:
      "New home construction in Penitas requires building permits through Hidalgo County, including engineered plans, site surveys, and inspections at every phase — foundation, framing, electrical, plumbing, and final. We manage the entire permitting process from application through certificate of occupancy so you never have to visit the county offices.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a custom home in Penitas?",
    answer:
      "Most custom homes in Penitas take 8 to 14 months from breaking ground to move-in, depending on size and complexity. Hidalgo County permitting typically takes 3 to 6 weeks. We provide a detailed construction schedule before you commit and keep you updated throughout every phase with regular progress reports.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is Penitas a good area to build a custom home?",
    answer:
      "Penitas offers some of the best value for custom home construction in the Valley. Land is more affordable than McAllen or Edinburg, lot sizes are larger, and the community is growing with new infrastructure. You are still only 20 minutes from McAllen on Expressway 83, with easy access to La Joya, Palmview, and the rest of Hidalgo County. More home on more land for less money — that is the western Valley advantage.",

      "Most custom home builders in the Valley are focused on McAllen, Mission, and Edinburg. Western Hidalgo County gets overlooked.

            Penitas and western Hidalgo County offer something the McAllen metro cannot — larger lots at lower prices, just 20 minutes west on Expressway 83. Families are discovering that the same budget that buys a cookie-cutter tract home in north McAllen can build a fully custom home on a generous lot in Penitas. More square footage, more land, more of exactly what you want — without the McAllen price tag.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            The challenge has been finding a builder willing to work here. Most custom home builders in the Valley concentrate on McAllen, Mission, and Edinburg where the volume is. Western Hidalgo County gets treated as too far, too small, or too much hassle. That leaves homeowners with land and a vision but no qualified builder to execute it. Tekton fills that gap because we see what is happening in Penitas — a growing community with real demand and families who deserve quality construction.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            We also know the ground you are building on. Caliche soil is a reality throughout the western Valley. It requires specific foundation engineering, proper drainage design, and excavation equipment that generic builders do not plan for. We test every lot before we design, engineer for what we find, and give you a fixed price that accounts for the actual conditions — not a guess that turns into change orders.
