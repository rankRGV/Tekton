    question: "Do you really serve Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Yes — and we're one of the few quality contractors who actively does. Rio Grande City and Starr County are part of our regular service area. We don't charge extra for the drive from McAllen, and we bring the same crew, materials, and standards as every job we do.",
  },
  {
    question: "What challenges are unique to building in Starr County?",
    answer:
      "Starr County has caliche-heavy soil that affects foundations, pool construction, and drainage. The extreme heat is even more intense in the upper Valley. And the limited contractor availability means homeowners often settle for less. We engineer our work specifically for these conditions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build a custom home on my land in Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We build custom homes on your lot anywhere in the RGV, including Rio Grande City and Starr County. We'll evaluate your lot for buildability — soil conditions, utilities, flood zone status, setbacks — and design a home that fits your vision and the land.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started on a project in Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Call us at (956) 862-7643 or fill out our contact form. We'll schedule a free on-site consultation at your Rio Grande City property, assess the scope of work, and provide a detailed estimate. We make the drive — you don't have to come to us.",

            Rio Grande City is the heart of Starr County — and homeowners here have long been underserved by quality contractors. Most crews are based in McAllen or further east and don't want to make the drive. We do. Rio Grande City and the surrounding communities along Highway 83 West are part of our active service area.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            The upper Valley has its own set of challenges. Homes in Rio Grande City deal with extreme heat, caliche-heavy soil that affects foundations and pool construction, and limited access to the caliber of contractors available in the McAllen metro. We bring McAllen-quality work to Starr County — same materials, same crew, same standards.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Whether you need a roof replaced, a pool built, a home remodeled, or a custom home constructed on your property — Tekton delivers the same level of service in Rio Grande City that we provide in McAllen. Distance doesn't change our standards.
