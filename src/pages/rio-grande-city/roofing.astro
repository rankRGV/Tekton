    question: "Do you travel all the way to Rio Grande City for roofing work?",
    answer:
      "Yes — Rio Grande City is part of our regular service area. We're headquartered in McAllen and our crews work throughout Starr County. We've roofed homes along Highway 83 West from Sullivan City through Rio Grande City and beyond. Distance is never a factor in our quality or warranty coverage.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Rio Grande City's extreme heat affect roofing materials?",
    answer:
      "Rio Grande City sits in the upper Valley where summer temperatures regularly push past 105°F. That kind of heat breaks down standard shingles faster than in coastal areas. We install UV-resistant, heat-rated materials — impact-resistant shingles, reflective metal roofing, and concrete tile — all designed to handle Starr County's brutal summers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there many roofers that actually serve Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Honestly, no. Most Valley roofers focus on McAllen and Edinburg. Rio Grande City homeowners often get quoted higher prices or longer wait times because contractors treat it as a long drive. We don't. We price Rio Grande City jobs the same as McAllen jobs and hold the same timeline standards.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle insurance claims for storm-damaged roofs in Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We document all damage with photos, file the claim paperwork, and meet your adjuster on-site at your Rio Grande City home. Starr County sees the same spring hailstorms as the rest of the Valley, and many homeowners don't realize their policy covers a full replacement until we inspect.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does caliche soil in Starr County cause roof problems?",
    answer:
      "Indirectly, yes. Caliche soil expands and contracts with moisture, which can cause foundation shifting. When foundations move, roof lines shift too — leading to cracked flashing, gaps, and leaks. We inspect the full structure, not just the shingles, so we catch these issues before they become expensive.",

            Starr County Roofs Face the Worst of Valley Heat
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Rio Grande City sits in the upper Valley where temperatures run hotter than the coast — regularly pushing past 105°F in summer. That extreme heat, combined with UV exposure and spring hailstorms rolling up the Highway 83 West corridor, puts enormous stress on roofing materials that weren't designed for this climate.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Most Starr County homeowners are underserved by roofing contractors who focus on McAllen and Edinburg. That means fewer options, higher quotes, and longer wait times. We treat Rio Grande City as part of our core service area — same fair pricing, same fast timelines, same warranty that backs every job we do.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Because we also build custom homes and handle full remodels, we understand how roofing connects to the structure beneath it. In an area where caliche soil can shift foundations and compromise roof lines, that big-picture knowledge means a roof that actually lasts.
