    question: "Do you take on remodeling projects in Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Yes — Rio Grande City is part of our regular service area. We handle kitchen remodels, bathroom renovations, whole-home updates, and everything in between throughout Starr County. Our McAllen headquarters is a straight shot down Highway 83, and we treat RGC projects with the same priority as local jobs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How old are most homes in Rio Grande City that need remodeling?",
    answer:
      "Many Rio Grande City homes were built in the 1970s through 1990s and haven't had a major update since. Outdated kitchens, cramped bathrooms, old wiring, and inefficient layouts are common. We specialize in modernizing older Starr County homes while preserving their character and working within realistic budgets.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remodel older historic buildings in downtown Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Downtown Rio Grande City has some beautiful older structures that deserve thoughtful renovation. We've worked with older building types throughout the Valley and understand how to modernize interiors while respecting existing architecture. We handle any structural surprises — old wiring, outdated plumbing, load-bearing walls — that come with older buildings.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a kitchen remodel cost in Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Kitchen remodels in Rio Grande City typically range from $15,000 for a cosmetic refresh to $60,000+ for a full gut-and-rebuild with new cabinets, countertops, appliances, and layout changes. We provide a detailed, line-item estimate after visiting your home — no surprise costs and no distance surcharges.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need permits for a remodel in Starr County?",
    answer:
      "Most remodels that involve structural changes, electrical work, or plumbing modifications require Starr County permits. We handle all permitting for you — from application through final inspection. You don't have to navigate the process on your own.",

            Older Starr County Homes Deserve a Modern Update
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Many Rio Grande City homes were built decades ago with layouts that don't match how families live today. Small kitchens, cramped bathrooms, dark hallways, and worn-out finishes are the norm in neighborhoods across Starr County. These homes have good bones — they just need someone who knows how to bring them into the present.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            The problem has always been access to quality contractors. Most remodeling companies focus on McAllen and the metro area, leaving Rio Grande City homeowners with limited options. We're changing that. We bring the same materials, craftsmanship, and project management to Starr County that our McAllen clients expect — at the same prices.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Whether it's a downtown building that needs thoughtful modernization or a 1980s ranch house that needs a complete kitchen overhaul, we handle it. And because we also build custom homes, we understand structure, systems, and code at a level most remodelers don't.
