  {
    question: "Can you build a custom home on a ranch lot in Starr County?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We've built on rural and semi-rural lots throughout the Valley. Ranch and acreage properties in Starr County often require well and septic systems, longer utility runs, and access road considerations. We handle all of that — from site prep to final walkthrough.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does caliche soil affect building a custom home in Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Caliche is a dense, calcium-rich soil layer common in Starr County. It requires specialized excavation for foundations and utility trenches. The upside is that caliche provides excellent bearing capacity once properly prepared. We engineer every foundation for the specific soil conditions on your lot — no generic plans.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there custom home builders that serve Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Very few quality builders work in the upper Valley. Most focus on McAllen, Edinburg, and the metro area. We bring McAllen-quality construction to Rio Grande City — same materials, same crews, same standards. Your Starr County home gets the same attention as any build in the metro.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to build a custom home in Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Custom homes in the Rio Grande City area typically range from $150 to $250+ per square foot depending on finishes, features, and lot complexity. Land is often more affordable in Starr County than the metro, which means your overall project cost can be very competitive. We provide a detailed estimate after understanding your vision and evaluating your lot.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a custom home in Starr County?",
    answer:
      "Most custom homes take 8 to 14 months from groundbreaking to move-in, depending on size and complexity. Rural lots may add time for utility connections. We set a realistic timeline upfront and keep you updated with regular progress reports throughout the build.",

            Your Land in Starr County, Our Expertise Building On It
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Starr County has something the McAllen metro is running out of — affordable land. Spacious ranch lots, rural acreage, and in-town properties where you can build exactly the home you want without subdivision restrictions or postage-stamp yards. The opportunity is real.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            The challenge has always been finding a builder willing to bring quality construction to the upper Valley. Most custom home builders stay in the metro. We don't. We build in Rio Grande City with the same materials, the same crews, and the same standards as our McAllen custom homes — engineered for Starr County's caliche soil and built to handle the extreme heat.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Whether you're building on a ranch property outside town or an in-town lot near the historic downtown, we handle everything — soil engineering, foundation design, utility coordination, permitting, and construction. One company, one point of contact, start to finish.
