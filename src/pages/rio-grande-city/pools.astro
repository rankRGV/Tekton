    question: "Can you build a pool in Rio Grande City's caliche soil?",
    answer:
      "Yes — and this is exactly why you need a builder who understands Starr County ground conditions. Caliche is a hard, calcium-rich layer that requires specialized excavation equipment and engineering. We've built pools in caliche-heavy areas throughout the upper Valley and know how to engineer the shell, drainage, and steel reinforcement to handle it properly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there pool builders that actually serve Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Very few. Most pool companies focus on McAllen, Edinburg, and the metro area. Rio Grande City homeowners often get told it's 'too far' or get quoted a premium for the drive. We serve Starr County at the same pricing as our McAllen builds — no distance surcharge.",
  },
  {
    question: "What permits do I need for a pool in Starr County?",
    answer:
      "Pool construction in Starr County requires building permits, electrical permits, and compliance with local setback requirements. We handle all Starr County permitting for you — from application to final inspection. You don't have to set foot in a government office.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a pool in Rio Grande City?",
    answer:
      "Most custom gunite pools take 6 to 10 weeks from excavation to swim day. Caliche soil can add a few days to the excavation phase, but we plan for that upfront. We keep you updated throughout the build with regular progress reports.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a pool worth it in Rio Grande City with the extreme heat?",
    answer:
      "Rio Grande City is one of the hottest spots in the Valley — summer temperatures regularly exceed 105°F. A pool isn't a luxury here, it's practically a necessity. You get 9+ months of swim weather, and a well-built pool adds real value to your property in Starr County's growing market.",

            Pools Built for Starr County Ground and Heat

          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Rio Grande City is one of the hottest places in the Rio Grande Valley — and that makes a backyard pool more than a nice-to-have. With 9+ months of swim weather and summer temperatures regularly exceeding 105°F, a pool is how you and your family actually enjoy your property.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            But building a pool in Starr County takes specialized knowledge. The caliche-heavy soil requires extra excavation engineering that most Valley pool builders don't bother with. Cut corners on caliche, and you end up with a cracked shell and expensive repairs. We engineer every pool for the exact ground conditions on your lot — proper steel reinforcement, proper drainage, proper compaction.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Rio Grande City homeowners have been underserved by pool builders who won't make the drive from McAllen. We're here to change that. Same quality, same pricing, same warranty — no matter where you are in the Valley.
