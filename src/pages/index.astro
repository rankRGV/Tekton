    question: "What areas does Tekton Home Solutions serve?",
    answer:
      "We serve 8 cities across the Rio Grande Valley: McAllen (our headquarters), Mission, Edinburg, Pharr, Brownsville, Harlingen, Rio Grande City, and Penitas. We don't charge extra based on distance — same pricing across the entire RGV.",
  },
  {
    question: "What services does Tekton offer?",
    answer:
      "We handle four core home services: roofing (replacement, repair, storm damage), pool construction (custom gunite pools), home remodeling (kitchens, bathrooms, whole-home), and custom home building (build on your lot). One contractor, one team, no subcontractor juggling.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer free estimates?",
    answer:
      "Yes — every project starts with a free on-site inspection and estimate. We come to your home, assess the scope of work, and give you a detailed, line-item quote with no hidden costs. Call (956) 862-7643 or use our contact form to schedule.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is your price match guarantee?",
    answer:
      "Bring us any written estimate from a licensed, insured contractor in the RGV for the same scope of work — we'll match it. We believe quality work and fair pricing go together. You shouldn't have to choose.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are you licensed and insured?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Tekton Home Solutions is fully licensed and insured. We carry general liability insurance, workers' compensation coverage, and pull permits for every job that requires them. We're a legitimate operation — not a truck and a handshake.",
  },
