  {
    question: "What does Edinburg's soil mean for pool construction?",
    answer:
      "Edinburg has expansive clay soil that swells when wet and shrinks when dry — a common issue across north Hidalgo County. A pool built without accounting for these conditions will crack. We engineer every gunite pool with reinforced steel, proper drainage, and compacted fill specifically for Edinburg's ground conditions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a pool in Edinburg?",
    answer:
      "Most custom gunite pools in Edinburg take 6 to 10 weeks from excavation to swim day. Timeline depends on size, features, and permitting. We keep you updated throughout and don't juggle your project with five other jobs — your build stays on schedule.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do Edinburg subdivisions require permits or HOA approval for pools?",
    answer:
      "Yes — the City of Edinburg requires building permits for pool construction, and many newer subdivisions north of Trenton Road have HOA rules about pool placement, fencing, and equipment screening. We handle all permits and HOA submissions as part of the project.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build a pool in a new Edinburg subdivision backyard?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Many of Edinburg's newer subdivisions have standard lot sizes that work perfectly for custom pools. We design pools to maximize your usable backyard space — even on tighter lots near the UTRGV area. We've fit beautiful pools into backyards other builders said were too small.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer pool financing in Edinburg?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we offer financing options so Edinburg homeowners can start enjoying their pool without paying everything upfront. Custom gunite pools typically range from $35,000 to $80,000+ depending on size and features. We walk you through options during your free design consultation.",

            Edinburg Is Growing — Your Backyard Should Keep Up
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Edinburg is one of the fastest-growing cities in the RGV. New subdivisions are going up north of Trenton Road, around the UTRGV campus, and along the Sugar Road corridor. Families are moving in — and they want backyards that actually get used. A custom pool turns a standard subdivision lot into the place your family wants to be.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            But building a pool in Edinburg requires a builder who understands north Hidalgo County soil. The expansive clay here swells and contracts with moisture changes, putting enormous stress on a pool shell. We engineer every gunite pool with the proper steel reinforcement, drainage, and compaction to handle these conditions. Our pools don't crack because we build them for the ground they sit in.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            And because Tekton also builds custom homes and handles full remodels, your pool project gets coordinated with everything else — electrical, gas lines, drainage grading, outdoor kitchens. One company, one point of contact, zero finger-pointing between contractors.
