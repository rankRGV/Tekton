    question: "Do you handle roofing across all of Edinburg, TX?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we cover every part of Edinburg, from the older neighborhoods near the courthouse downtown to the fast-growing subdivisions north of Trenton Road and along Sugar Road. As a Hidalgo County-based company, Edinburg is central to our service area.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Edinburg in a hail-prone zone?",
    answer:
      "Edinburg sits right in the north Hidalgo County hail corridor. Spring storms regularly bring damaging hail, and the 2024 and 2025 seasons hit Edinburg neighborhoods especially hard. We install Class 4 impact-resistant shingles rated specifically for Texas hail zones — and many insurance companies offer premium discounts for them.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can you replace a roof in Edinburg?",
    answer:
      "Most Edinburg residential roofs are completed in a single day — 24 hours from tear-off to final cleanup. Larger or more complex roofs may take two days. We schedule efficiently so your Edinburg home isn't exposed to weather any longer than absolutely necessary.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with insurance companies for Edinburg storm claims?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We've handled hundreds of insurance claims in the Edinburg area. We photograph and document all damage, meet your adjuster at your Edinburg property, and advocate for the full payout your policy allows. Many Edinburg homeowners are surprised how much their claim actually covers once we get involved.",
  },
  {
    question: "What roofing options work best near UTRGV in Edinburg?",
    answer:
      "Homes in the UTRGV area — especially rental properties and investor-owned homes — benefit from durable, low-maintenance roofing. We recommend impact-resistant architectural shingles or standing seam metal for longevity. Both handle Edinburg's heat and hail while keeping long-term costs down.",

            Edinburg Roofs Face the Hail Corridor Head-On
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Edinburg sits in the heart of north Hidalgo County's hail corridor. Spring storms roll through with damaging hail, summer heat cracks and curls cheap shingles, and hurricane season tests every fastener on your roof. The UTRGV area and neighborhoods along Sugar Road and Trenton Road have seen some of the worst storm damage in recent years.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            The difference between a roof that survives and one that doesn't comes down to materials and workmanship. We install impact-resistant shingles rated for Texas hail zones, reflective metal roofing that cuts cooling costs in Edinburg's brutal summers, and tile systems built for extreme heat. Every roof is engineered for the conditions right here in the county seat.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Edinburg is growing fast — new subdivisions are going up north of Trenton and around the UTRGV campus. Whether your home is a newer build that took storm damage or an older downtown Edinburg property that needs a full replacement, we handle it the same way: premium materials, one-day installation, and a warranty backed by a local company.
