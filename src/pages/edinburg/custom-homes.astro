    question: "Where are the best areas to build a custom home in Edinburg?",
    answer:
      "North Edinburg is where most of the growth is happening — available lots along Trenton Road, north of Chapin, and in newer developments near the UTRGV campus. We also see families building on larger parcels in rural north Hidalgo County just outside Edinburg city limits. We help you evaluate lots for soil, drainage, and utility access before you commit.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to build a custom home in Edinburg, TX?",
    answer:
      "Custom homes in Edinburg typically range from $150 to $250+ per square foot depending on finishes, lot preparation, and complexity. A 2,000 sq ft home might start around $300,000, while a fully custom 3,500 sq ft home with premium finishes could be $700,000+. We provide a detailed, transparent estimate after the design phase.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build on my own lot in Edinburg?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely — build-on-your-lot is one of our core services. If you already own land in or around Edinburg, we handle everything from soil testing and site prep to final walkthrough. If you're still looking for land, we can advise on lot selection based on soil conditions, drainage, and access to utilities.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is UTRGV growth affecting custom home building in Edinburg?",
    answer:
      "UTRGV has transformed Edinburg's real estate market. Demand for quality housing — from faculty homes to family properties near campus — has driven new development north of the university. More families want to be close to the economic growth UTRGV brings while still having a custom-built home on a real lot, not a cookie-cutter tract home.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a custom home in Edinburg?",
    answer:
      "Most custom homes in Edinburg take 8 to 14 months from breaking ground to move-in, depending on size and complexity. The design and permitting phase adds 4 to 8 weeks before construction starts. We give you a detailed schedule and keep you updated throughout the entire build.",

          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Edinburg's growth is undeniable. UTRGV has brought economic energy, new families, and demand for quality housing that the county seat hasn't seen before. Available lots along Trenton Road, north of Chapin, and in the areas surrounding the university are being snapped up by families who want something better than a production home.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Building custom in Edinburg means your home is designed for your family — not for the builder's profit margin. We start with how you live: open kitchen or separate? Home office or flex room? Covered patio for entertaining or low-maintenance yard? Every decision is yours, guided by our experience building homes across Hidalgo County.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            And because Tekton also does roofing, pools, and remodeling, we think about your home as a complete property from day one. We plan for a future pool, wire for outdoor kitchens, and build roof systems rated for the hail corridor — all during initial construction, when it's cheapest and easiest to do right.
