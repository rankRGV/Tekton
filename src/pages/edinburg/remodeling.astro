    question: "What types of remodeling do you do in Edinburg?",
    answer:
      "We handle kitchen remodels, bathroom remodels, whole-home renovations, room additions, and interior updates for Edinburg homes. Whether it's a full gut renovation of an older downtown Edinburg home or a kitchen upgrade in a newer subdivision, we do it all — design through final walkthrough.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Edinburg, TX?",
    answer:
      "Kitchen remodels in Edinburg typically range from $15,000 for a basic refresh to $60,000+ for a full custom renovation with new cabinetry, countertops, appliances, and layout changes. We provide detailed line-item estimates after visiting your home — no guesswork and no hidden fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do older Edinburg homes near downtown need special renovation work?",
    answer:
      "Yes — homes in the older parts of Edinburg near the courthouse and along the Freddy Gonzalez corridor often have outdated electrical, plumbing that needs updating, and layouts that don't match modern living. We specialize in bringing these homes up to code while preserving their county seat character.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a full bathroom remodel take in Edinburg?",
    answer:
      "A typical Edinburg bathroom remodel takes 3 to 5 weeks depending on scope. If we're moving plumbing or expanding the footprint, it can take longer. We give you a realistic timeline upfront and keep you updated throughout — no disappearing for weeks at a time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle permits for Edinburg remodeling projects?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we pull all necessary City of Edinburg permits for structural work, electrical, and plumbing. We also coordinate inspections so everything is done to code. You don't have to deal with city hall — that's our job.",

            Edinburg Homes Have Character — Let's Bring Them Up to Date
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            As the Hidalgo County seat, Edinburg has a mix of housing stock you won't find anywhere else in the RGV. Older homes near downtown and along the Freddy Gonzalez corridor have solid construction and real character — but kitchens from the 1980s, cramped bathrooms, and floor plans that don't work for modern families.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Meanwhile, newer Edinburg subdivisions north of Trenton and near the UTRGV campus often need upgrades too — builder-grade finishes that look dated after a few years, small master bathrooms, and kitchens that need more counter space and storage. Whether your Edinburg home is 5 years old or 50, we make it work better for how you live now.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Because Tekton also builds custom homes from the ground up, we bring a builder's perspective to every remodel. We understand structure, load-bearing walls, electrical capacity, and plumbing routing — which means we can open up walls and reconfigure layouts that other remodelers won't touch.
