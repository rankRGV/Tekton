    question: "How much does a home remodel cost in the RGV?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the scope. A kitchen remodel in the Rio Grande Valley typically ranges from $15,000 to $50,000+, and a bathroom remodel from $8,000 to $25,000+. Full-home remodels vary widely based on square footage and finishes. We provide a detailed, line-item estimate after your design consultation — no hidden fees, no surprise change orders.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a kitchen remodel take?",
    answer:
      "Most kitchen remodels take 4 to 8 weeks depending on the scope — a cosmetic refresh (cabinets, countertops, backsplash) is faster, while a full gut renovation with layout changes takes longer. We give you a realistic timeline upfront and keep you updated throughout. No dragging it out for months.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to move out during a remodel?",
    answer:
      "For most kitchen and bathroom remodels, no — you can stay in your home. We section off the work area, manage dust and debris, and keep disruption to a minimum. For whole-home remodels or major structural work, we'll discuss whether temporary relocation makes sense and help you plan around it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle permits for remodeling projects?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Any structural, electrical, or plumbing changes require permits in Hidalgo County. We handle the full permitting process — application, inspections, sign-offs — so you don't have to deal with the city. We also manage HOA approvals if your subdivision requires them.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you match a design I found on Pinterest or Instagram?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Bring us your inspiration photos and we'll work with you to recreate that look within your budget. We'll tell you honestly what's achievable in your space and suggest smart alternatives where needed. Our goal is to get you a result you love — not upsell you on things you don't need.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in a full kitchen remodel?",
    answer:
      "Our full kitchen remodels typically include demolition, new cabinets, countertops (granite, quartz, or marble), backsplash tile, flooring, lighting, plumbing fixtures, painting, and appliance installation. We handle everything from design through final cleanup — one crew, one point of contact.",

            Your Home Should Fit Your Life — Not the Other Way Around
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            That cramped kitchen. The outdated bathroom. The layout that made sense 20 years ago but doesn't work for your family now. You've been living with it long enough. A well-planned remodel doesn't just update the look — it changes how you use your home every single day.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            At Tekton Home Solutions, we handle everything from cosmetic refreshes to full gut renovations. New cabinets and countertops. Opening up walls to create an open floor plan. Adding a master suite. Converting a garage into living space. Whatever your home needs — we design it, permit it, build it, and clean up after it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            And because we also build custom homes from the ground up, we bring a level of structural knowledge that most remodeling-only companies don't have. We know what's behind your walls before we open them — and that means fewer surprises, fewer delays, and a better finished product.
