    question: "Do you serve all of Mission, TX for roofing?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we serve all of Mission, from the neighborhoods near Shary Road and Conway Ave to the newer developments south of Expressway 83. We also cover surrounding areas like Palmhurst and La Joya. As a McAllen-headquartered company, Mission is just minutes from our office.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do Mission's hail and wind patterns affect my roof?",
    answer:
      "Mission sits in the same hail corridor as the rest of western Hidalgo County. Spring storms can bring golf ball-sized hail, and hurricane season brings sustained winds that test every roof. We install impact-resistant shingles rated for Texas hail zones and wind-rated systems designed for Gulf Coast conditions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with insurance claims for storm damage in Mission?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We've handled hundreds of insurance claims across Hidalgo County. We document every detail of the damage, meet with your adjuster on-site at your Mission home, and fight for the full payout. Many Mission homeowners don't realize how much their policy actually covers until we get involved.",
  },
  {
    question: "What roofing materials do you recommend for Mission homes?",
    answer:
      "For most Mission homes, we recommend Class 4 impact-resistant shingles — they handle hail, they reflect heat, and many insurance companies offer premium discounts for them. For Mission homeowners wanting maximum longevity, standing seam metal roofing is an excellent choice that lasts 40+ years in our climate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with Mission HOAs like Cimarron or Sharyland?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we're familiar with the requirements for Mission's major subdivisions. We handle HOA paperwork, submit material and color samples for approval, and make sure your new roof meets all community standards before we start work.",

            Mission Roofs Take Serious Punishment
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Mission homeowners face the same brutal conditions as the rest of western Hidalgo County — triple-digit heat from May through October, UV bombardment that breaks down cheap shingles, spring hailstorms that can total a roof in minutes, and hurricane-season winds that test every fastener.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            The difference between a roof that lasts 10 years and one that lasts 25 comes down to materials and installation. We use impact-resistant shingles rated for Texas hail zones, reflective metal roofing that cuts cooling costs, and tile options built for extreme heat. Every roof we install is engineered for the conditions right here in Mission.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            And because we also build custom homes, pools, and do full remodels, we understand how your roof connects to insulation, ventilation, and structural integrity. That big-picture expertise means a better, longer-lasting roof.
