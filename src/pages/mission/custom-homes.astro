    question: "Where are people building custom homes in Mission?",
    answer:
      "The most active custom home areas in Mission right now are south of Expressway 83 toward the La Joya corridor, the Palmhurst area along Taylor Road, and scattered lots near Bryan Road and Conway. Some homeowners are also building on larger tracts closer to the river. We'll help you evaluate any Mission-area lot before you commit.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a custom home in Mission?",
    answer:
      "Most custom homes in the Mission area take 8–12 months from foundation to move-in, depending on size and complexity. Smaller homes (under 2,500 sq ft) can be faster; larger estate-style homes with pools and outdoor kitchens may take 14+ months. We lock in a schedule before breaking ground.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Mission have different building codes than McAllen?",
    answer:
      "Yes — the City of Mission has its own permitting department and inspection requirements that differ from McAllen and Hidalgo County. Properties in the Palmhurst area may fall under different jurisdiction as well. We handle all permitting and know exactly which authority has jurisdiction over your lot.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build the pool at the same time as the house?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely — and that's one of our biggest advantages. Most builders outsource pool work to a separate contractor, which means competing timelines and torn-up yards. We build your home, pool, outdoor kitchen, and patio as one integrated project. Your backyard is finished when you move in, not six months later.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a custom home cost in Mission compared to McAllen?",
    answer:
      "Land costs in Mission are generally lower than north McAllen, which means more of your budget goes toward the actual home. Construction costs run $140 to $230+ per square foot depending on finishes. We provide a full cost breakdown during design so you know exactly where every dollar goes before committing.",

            Mission Has the Land — We Build the Home
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Mission offers something hard to find in the rest of the McAllen metro — affordable lots with room to build. South of Expressway 83, along the La Joya corridor, and throughout the Palmhurst area, families are finding half-acre and full-acre tracts at prices that make custom building realistic. You get the space, the privacy, and a home designed exactly the way you want it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            But building in Mission requires a contractor who understands the local landscape. Soil conditions vary significantly — sandy loam near the river, heavy clay further north. The City of Mission has its own permitting process that's different from McAllen. And properties in the Palmhurst ETJ have yet another set of requirements. We've built across all these jurisdictions and know how to navigate each one.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            The biggest advantage of building custom in Mission is value. Lower land costs mean more of your budget goes into the house itself — better cabinets, better countertops, a bigger outdoor living area. And because we also build pools and outdoor kitchens, your backyard can be move-in ready the same day as your home. No waiting months for a separate pool contractor to squeeze you into their schedule.
