    question: "Can you build a pool in Mission's clay soil?",
    answer:
      "Yes — and this is exactly why you need a builder who knows the RGV. Mission's expansive clay soil shifts with moisture changes, which can crack a poorly built pool shell. We engineer our gunite pools with the proper steel reinforcement and drainage to handle Valley soil conditions. We've built pools across Hidalgo County and know how to do it right.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a pool cost in Mission, TX?",
    answer:
      "Custom gunite pools in Mission typically range from $35,000 to $80,000+ depending on size, shape, features, and decking. We provide a detailed, line-item estimate after visiting your property — no surprises. We also offer financing options so you can start enjoying your pool sooner.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need HOA approval for a pool in Mission?",
    answer:
      "Many Mission subdivisions — including Cimarron Country Club, Sharyland, and newer developments off Conway — have rules about pool placement, fencing, and equipment screening. We check your HOA requirements before design and handle the approval process for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best time of year to start building a pool in Mission?",
    answer:
      "Fall through early spring is ideal — you'll beat the summer rush, construction moves faster in cooler weather, and your pool will be ready by the time it heats up. But we build year-round. The RGV climate means there's no true off-season for pool construction.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build pools with outdoor kitchens or pergolas?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Because we're a full home solutions company — not just a pool company — we can build your pool, outdoor kitchen, pergola, and decking as one coordinated project. One crew, one timeline, one point of contact. That's a huge advantage over hiring separate contractors.",

    title: "\"I'm worried the pool will crack in this soil\"",

      "Valid concern — Mission's clay soil is notorious. We engineer every pool for Valley soil conditions with proper steel reinforcement, drainage, and compaction. Our pools don't crack because we build them for the ground they sit in.",

            Mission Backyards Deserve Better
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            With 8+ months of pool weather every year, a backyard pool in Mission isn't a luxury — it's how you actually enjoy your home. Kids playing, family gathering on weekends, cooling off after a long day — that's what a pool is really about.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            But building a pool in Mission takes more than digging a hole. The Valley's expansive clay soil shifts with every rain cycle. Cheap builders who don't account for soil conditions end up with cracked shells and warranty nightmares. We engineer every pool for the specific ground conditions on your property — proper steel, proper drainage, proper compaction.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            And because Tekton also builds custom homes and handles full remodels, we coordinate your pool with the rest of your property — drainage, electrical, gas, landscaping grading. No surprises, no conflicts between contractors, no finger-pointing.
