    question: "Do you serve all of Mission for remodeling work?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we cover all of Mission, from the established neighborhoods near Shary Road and Bryan Road to the newer developments along the Conway corridor and south of Expressway 83. We also serve Palmhurst and surrounding areas. Our McAllen headquarters is just 10 minutes away.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Mission, TX?",
    answer:
      "Kitchen remodels in Mission typically range from $18,000 for a cosmetic refresh (new countertops, cabinets, backsplash) to $55,000+ for a full gut-and-rebuild with layout changes. We provide a detailed, line-item estimate after seeing your space — not a vague guess over the phone.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you update an older Mission home without gutting it?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Many Mission homes near Shary Road and the downtown area have great bones but dated finishes. We can resurface cabinets, replace countertops, update fixtures, install new flooring, and modernize the layout without tearing everything down to the studs. It depends on the condition — we'll tell you honestly what needs full replacement and what can be refreshed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for remodeling in Mission?",
    answer:
      "Any work involving structural changes, electrical, plumbing, or gas in the City of Mission requires a permit. We handle all permitting — we know what Mission inspectors require and schedule inspections to keep the project moving without delays.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will you work with my Mission HOA on exterior changes?",
    answer:
      "Yes — subdivisions like Cimarron Country Club and other Mission communities have specific rules about exterior modifications, paint colors, and material choices. We prepare all HOA paperwork and submit for approval before starting exterior work.",

            Mission Homes Deserve Modern Living
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Mission has a mix of housing stock that tells the story of the city's growth. Older homes near Shary Road and the downtown area — built in the '80s and '90s — have solid construction but cramped kitchens, small bathrooms, and finishes that belong in another decade. Neighborhoods along the Conway corridor and near Cimarron are newer but already showing their age with builder-grade materials that wore out fast.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            A smart remodel doesn't just make your Mission home look better — it changes how you live in it. Opening up a kitchen wall transforms how your family cooks and gathers. A master bath with a walk-in shower and proper ventilation means no more fighting mold in the Valley humidity. New flooring that can handle the sand and dirt that comes with South Texas living.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Because Tekton also builds custom homes and pools, we bring structural expertise to every remodel. When we open a wall, we know if it's load-bearing. When we move plumbing, we understand the whole system. That building-science knowledge is the difference between a remodel that lasts and one that causes problems down the road.
