          Built for McAllen Homeowners
        </h2>
        <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
          McAllen is home — it's where we're headquartered, where our crew lives, and where we've built our reputation one project at a time. From the established neighborhoods of North McAllen near Nolana and Ware Road to the newer developments off Lex Luther and Lark, we know this city inside and out.
        </p>
        <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
          South Texas heat, hailstorms, and high winds take a real toll on homes. That's why McAllen homeowners need a contractor who understands local building codes, HOA requirements, and the materials that hold up in this climate — not a crew from out of town who's here today and gone tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
          Whether you need a roof replaced after a storm, a pool built for your growing family, a kitchen remodeled to finally match your vision, or a custom home built from scratch — Tekton handles it all. One contractor, one point of contact, one team that actually picks up the phone.
