  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a pool in McAllen?",
    answer:
      "Most custom gunite pools in McAllen take 6–10 weeks from excavation to swim day. The timeline depends on pool size, features, and permitting. We give you a realistic schedule upfront — not the 4-week fantasy some builders promise just to close the deal.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Sharyland Plantation have pool building requirements?",
    answer:
      "Yes — Sharyland Plantation has specific rules about pool placement, setbacks, fencing height, and equipment screening. We've built multiple pools in Sharyland and know the HOA process inside and out. We handle the architectural review submission and make sure your design is approved before breaking ground.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build a pool in McAllen's clay soil without cracking?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely — but only if it's engineered properly. North McAllen in particular has heavy expansive clay that swells when wet and shrinks when dry. We reinforce every gunite shell with engineered steel rebar and install proper drainage systems around the pool to manage moisture movement. That's the difference between a pool that lasts 30 years and one that cracks in 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a custom pool cost in McAllen, TX?",
    answer:
      "Custom gunite pools in McAllen typically range from $38,000 to $85,000+ depending on size, shape, features, and decking material. Extras like spas, water features, and outdoor kitchens add to the cost. We provide a detailed, itemized estimate after visiting your property — no vague ballpark numbers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build a pool and outdoor kitchen together?",
    answer:
      "That's one of our biggest advantages. Because Tekton builds homes, does remodels, and constructs pools, we handle everything — pool, outdoor kitchen, pergola, decking, lighting, gas lines — as one coordinated project. One contract, one crew, one timeline. No finger-pointing between separate contractors.",

    title: "\"I'm worried about the clay soil cracking our pool\"",

    description:

            McAllen Has the Longest Pool Season in Texas

          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            From March through November — sometimes even into December — McAllen temperatures make your backyard pool the center of daily life. That's over 8 months of swimming, weekend cookouts, and family time. No other investment pays off this many days per year.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            But McAllen's geology demands respect. The clay-heavy soil in neighborhoods like Sharyland Plantation and north McAllen near Trenton Road expands and contracts with moisture cycles. Builders who skip proper soil engineering end up with cracked shells and expensive repairs. We reinforce every pool with engineered steel rebar grids and install French drain systems around the perimeter to manage groundwater movement — the same approach we use when building custom home foundations in the Valley.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Whether you're in Tres Lagos planning a resort-style pool with a tanning ledge and waterfall, or you have a compact backyard off Nolana that needs a smart, space-efficient design — we build pools that fit your property, your family, and your budget.
