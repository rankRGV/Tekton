    question: "Can you build on my lot in McAllen?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we build on owner-provided lots throughout McAllen and Hidalgo County. Whether you've purchased land in north McAllen near Trenton Road, have a lot in Sharyland, or are looking at acreage off Military Highway, we'll evaluate your site for soil conditions, utilities, and drainage before design begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a custom home in McAllen?",
    answer:
      "Most custom homes in McAllen take 8–14 months from foundation pour to move-in, depending on size, complexity, and feature selections. We provide a detailed construction schedule before breaking ground and keep you updated weekly throughout the build.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle Sharyland Plantation architectural reviews?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Sharyland Plantation has one of the most detailed architectural review processes in the Valley — specific requirements for elevations, materials, landscaping, and even mailbox styles. We've navigated this process multiple times and prepare submissions that get approved without back-and-forth delays.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost to build a custom home in McAllen?",
    answer:
      "Custom homes in McAllen typically range from $150 to $250+ per square foot depending on finishes, features, and lot conditions. A 2,500 sq ft home might start around $375,000, while a 4,000+ sq ft home with premium finishes can exceed $800,000. We give you a detailed cost breakdown during the design phase — no surprises at closing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you also build our pool and outdoor living area?",
    answer:
      "That's one of our biggest advantages. Most custom home builders subcontract pool work to a separate company, which means separate timelines, separate budgets, and finger-pointing when things don't line up. We build the home, the pool, the outdoor kitchen, and the landscaping as one integrated project.",

            McAllen Is Growing — Build It Your Way
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            North McAllen is one of the fastest-growing corridors in the Rio Grande Valley. New lots are opening up around Trenton Road, Tres Lagos continues to expand, and Sharyland Plantation still has premium homesites available. But the production builders filling those lots are stamping out the same five floor plans over and over.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            A custom home means your kitchen faces the direction you want, your master suite has the layout that fits your life, and your outdoor living area connects to your pool and patio exactly the way you envisioned it. It means a home that's built around how your family actually lives — not how a developer's spreadsheet says you should.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            And because Tekton also builds pools and handles full remodels, we can integrate your outdoor living space, swimming pool, and landscaping into the original build — not as afterthought add-ons that require tearing up a brand-new backyard. One project, one team, one budget.
