    question: "What roofing materials work best in McAllen's climate?",
    answer:
      "McAllen's intense heat, UV exposure, and occasional hailstorms demand durable materials. We recommend impact-resistant Class 4 shingles for hail protection, metal roofing for longevity and heat reflection, and concrete tile for a premium look that handles the heat. We'll help you choose based on your home, budget, and neighborhood requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with McAllen HOAs on roofing approvals?",
    answer:
      "Yes — many McAllen subdivisions like Sharyland Plantation, Tres Lagos, and Palm View Estates have strict HOA guidelines on roofing materials and colors. We handle the approval process directly with your HOA, submit the required documentation, and ensure your new roof meets all community standards.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can you start a roof replacement in McAllen?",
    answer:
      "Since we're headquartered right here in McAllen, we can typically start within a few days of signing your agreement. For emergency storm damage, we prioritize local calls and can have a crew on-site even faster. Most jobs are completed in a single day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Tekton licensed and insured to do roofing in McAllen?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We're fully licensed, bonded, and insured to perform all roofing work in McAllen and throughout Hidalgo County. We carry both general liability and workers' compensation insurance — ask us for proof anytime. We're not a fly-by-night crew; our office is at 1720 W Maple Ave Suite 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer financing for roof replacements in McAllen?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we offer flexible financing options so a new roof doesn't have to break the bank. We also work directly with your insurance company on storm damage claims to minimize your out-of-pocket costs. Contact us for a free estimate and we'll walk you through all your payment options.",

            McAllen's Climate Is Tough on Roofs
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Triple-digit heat, UV bombardment 300+ days a year, sudden hailstorms, and hurricane-season winds — McAllen roofs take punishment that homes in cooler climates never face. The materials and installation methods that work up north fail down here.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            That's why we install roofing systems specifically engineered for the Rio Grande Valley. We use impact-resistant shingles rated for Texas hail zones, reflective metal roofing that cuts cooling costs, and tile options that outlast the competition.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            As McAllen's only home solutions company that also builds custom homes and does full remodels, we understand how your roof connects to everything else — insulation, ventilation, structural integrity. That big-picture thinking means a better, longer-lasting roof for you.
