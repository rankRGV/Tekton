  {
    question: "How long does a kitchen remodel take in McAllen?",
    answer:
      "A typical McAllen kitchen remodel takes 4–8 weeks depending on scope. A cosmetic refresh (cabinets, countertops, backsplash) is on the shorter end. A full gut-and-rebuild with layout changes, new plumbing, and electrical takes longer. We give you a detailed timeline before work starts — and we stick to it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need permits for remodeling in McAllen?",
    answer:
      "Any work that involves structural changes, electrical, plumbing, or gas lines requires a City of McAllen building permit. We handle all permitting for you — we know exactly what McAllen inspectors look for and make sure everything passes the first time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remodel my home while I still live in it?",
    answer:
      "Yes — most McAllen homeowners stay in their homes during a remodel. We phase the work to minimize disruption, contain dust, and keep at least one functional bathroom or kitchen area available when possible. We'll plan the logistics with you before day one.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle McAllen HOA approval for exterior remodels?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Subdivisions like Sharyland Plantation, Tres Lagos, and Palm View Estates all have exterior modification rules. We prepare the HOA submission with material specs, color samples, and project details so your remodel gets approved without delays.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the average cost of a bathroom remodel in McAllen?",
    answer:
      "McAllen bathroom remodels typically range from $12,000 for a standard update to $35,000+ for a full master bath transformation with walk-in shower, freestanding tub, and custom tile. We provide a line-item estimate after measuring your space — no surprises halfway through the project.",

      "It's the number-one remodeling complaint in McAllen. A contractor starts your kitchen demo and then vanishes for weeks chasing other jobs. Our dedicated crews are assigned to your project start-to-finish. You get a project manager with a phone number that actually answers.",

    title: "\"The final bill was way more than the estimate\"",
    description:
      "Budget surprises usually come from contractors who quote low to win the job, then hit you with change orders. We provide detailed, line-item estimates before work starts. If something unexpected comes up — old plumbing, hidden water damage — we discuss it with you before spending a dollar.",

            McAllen Homes Are Ready for an Upgrade
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Many of McAllen's most desirable neighborhoods — along Nolana, around Ware Road, and throughout the 10th Street corridor — are full of solid homes built in the 1990s and early 2000s. Great bones, but dated kitchens with laminate counters, builder-grade bathrooms, and floor plans that don't match how families live today.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Meanwhile, newer McAllen developments like Tres Lagos and north Sharyland are setting the bar with open-concept layouts, quartz countertops, and spa-style master baths. If your home doesn't keep up, it shows — in your daily comfort and in resale value.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            As a company that also builds custom homes from the ground up, we bring new-construction quality to every remodel. We understand structural systems, mechanical layouts, and how to open up walls safely — not just cosmetic fixes that look good for six months.
