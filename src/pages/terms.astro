          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Tekton Home Solutions provides roofing, pool construction, remodeling, and custom home building services in the Rio Grande Valley, Texas. The information on this website — including service descriptions, photos, and general pricing guidance — is provided for informational purposes. It does not constitute a binding offer or contract. Every project is different, and final scope, pricing, and timelines are determined through a formal estimate and written agreement.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Estimates and Pricing</h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Estimates provided by Tekton Home Solutions are based on the information available at the time of assessment. Actual costs may vary if project conditions change, additional work is discovered, or you request modifications to the original scope. We will communicate any changes in writing before proceeding. All pricing is finalized in a signed project agreement before work begins.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Project Agreements</h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg leading-relaxed">
            All construction and renovation work is governed by a separate written project agreement between you and Tekton Home Solutions. That agreement — not this webpage — defines the specific terms, scope, payment schedule, warranties, and responsibilities for your project. These website terms of service do not override or replace any signed project agreement.
