    question: "How long does it take to build a pool in the RGV?",
    answer:
      "Most custom inground pools take 6 to 10 weeks from dig to swim-ready, depending on size, features, and permitting. We give you a realistic timeline upfront — no bait-and-switch on completion dates. We also coordinate with the city for permits so you're not chasing paperwork.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of pools do you build?",
    answer:
      "We build gunite (concrete) pools — the gold standard for custom shapes, durability, and long-term value. Gunite handles South Texas heat and soil conditions better than fiberglass or vinyl. We do everything from simple rectangle plunge pools to full resort-style builds with spas, tanning ledges, and water features.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a pool cost in the Rio Grande Valley?",
    answer:
      "Custom gunite pools in the RGV typically range from $35,000 to $80,000+ depending on size, depth, features, and decking. We provide a detailed, line-item estimate after your design consultation — no hidden fees, no surprise change orders. We also offer financing options to make it work for your budget.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle permits and HOA approvals?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We handle the full permitting process with local municipalities and work directly with your HOA if your subdivision has guidelines on pool placement, fencing, or equipment screening. You don't have to deal with any of that — we manage it start to finish.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of warranty do your pools come with?",
    answer:
      "Our pools come with a structural warranty on the gunite shell plus warranties on equipment, plumbing, and finish. We also walk you through maintenance best practices so your pool stays in great shape for decades. We're local — if something comes up, we're a phone call away.",

            A pool isn't just a luxury — it's where your kids grow up, where you unwind after work, where family gathers on weekends. In the Rio Grande Valley, where it's pool weather 8+ months a year, it's one of the best investments you can make in your home and your quality of life.

          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            At Tekton Home Solutions, we build gunite pools — the strongest, most customizable option available. Unlike fiberglass shells or vinyl liners, gunite lets us build any shape, any depth, any feature you want. And it handles the RGV's extreme heat and expansive clay soil better than any other material.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Because we also do roofing, remodeling, and custom home builds, we understand how your pool fits into your entire property. Drainage, grading, electrical, gas lines — we see the big picture so your pool doesn't create problems for the rest of your home.
