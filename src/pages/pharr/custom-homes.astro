    question: "Where are the best lots to build a custom home in Pharr?",
    answer:
      "The Jackson Road corridor and areas south and east of Town Center have available lots suited for custom builds. Some families are also finding larger parcels on the edges of Pharr toward Alamo. We help evaluate lots for soil, drainage, utilities, and setbacks before you buy — so you know exactly what you're working with.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a custom home cost in Pharr, TX?",
    answer:
      "Custom homes in Pharr typically range from $140 to $240+ per square foot depending on finishes, lot prep, and design complexity. A 1,800 sq ft home might start around $250,000, while a 3,000+ sq ft custom build with premium finishes could reach $600,000+. We provide transparent estimates after the design phase — no hidden costs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Pharr a good place to build a custom home?",
    answer:
      "Pharr offers real advantages — lower lot costs compared to McAllen, proximity to McAllen amenities and shopping, access to international commerce, and a growing community. You get more home for your money in Pharr without sacrificing location. Property values are trending up as the city grows.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build on a lot I already own in Pharr?",
    answer:
      "Yes — build-on-your-lot is a core service. We evaluate your Pharr lot for soil conditions, drainage, and utility access, then design a home that fits the land and your budget. If the lot needs prep work — grading, clearing, utility connections — we handle that too.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the timeline for building a custom home in Pharr?",
    answer:
      "Most custom homes in Pharr take 8 to 14 months from ground-breaking to move-in. Design and permitting add 4 to 8 weeks before construction starts. We provide a detailed schedule and keep you updated with regular site visits and progress reports throughout the build.",

          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Pharr sits right next to McAllen — same shopping, same restaurants, same medical facilities — but with lower land costs and available lots that McAllen's running out of. The Jackson Road corridor, areas near Town Center, and Pharr's expanding growth zones offer real opportunities for families who want a custom home without McAllen's price premium.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Building custom in Pharr means every dollar goes into the home itself, not inflated lot prices. We design around your family — open kitchens for entertaining, home offices that actually work, covered patios that you'll use 10 months a year, and energy-efficient systems that keep your bills down in Valley heat.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            And because Tekton also handles roofing, pools, and remodeling, we plan your Pharr home as a complete property from day one. We pre-plumb for a future pool, wire for outdoor kitchens, and install roof systems rated for Hidalgo County hail — all during initial construction when it costs a fraction of retrofitting later.
