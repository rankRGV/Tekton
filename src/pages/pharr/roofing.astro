    question: "Do you provide roofing services across all of Pharr, TX?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we serve every part of Pharr, from the older neighborhoods along Cage Blvd and near the International Bridge to the newer homes along Sugar Road and south Pharr. As a Hidalgo County-based company, Pharr is minutes from our operations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do Pharr storms compare to the rest of the Valley?",
    answer:
      "Pharr gets the same hail and wind events that hit McAllen and Edinburg — it's all one storm system across central Hidalgo County. After major hail events, Pharr neighborhoods along Cage Blvd and Sugar Road often see significant roof damage. We recommend impact-resistant Class 4 shingles for maximum protection.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you replace my Pharr roof in one day?",
    answer:
      "Most Pharr residential roofs are completed in 24 hours — tear-off to cleanup in a single day. We bring the right crew size for your roof so you're not left with a tarped house overnight. Larger commercial or multi-story roofs may take two days.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle Pharr insurance claims for roof damage?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we handle the entire insurance process for Pharr homeowners. We inspect and photograph all damage, file the claim documentation, meet your adjuster at your property, and negotiate for the full payout. You don't have to deal with the insurance company directly.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes your roofing different from the door-knockers that show up after storms in Pharr?",
    answer:
      "We're a local Hidalgo County company — not a traveling crew that follows storm paths. We have a physical presence here, our warranty is backed by a real business, and we'll still be here in 10 years. Storm chasers do fast, cheap work and move to the next city. We do it right because our reputation depends on it.",

            Pharr Roofs Take the Same Beating as McAllen — They Deserve the Same Quality
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Pharr sits right next to McAllen, sharing the same storm systems, the same hail corridors, and the same brutal summer heat. Homes along Cage Blvd, near the International Bridge commerce area, and throughout the Sugar Road corridor face the full force of Valley weather — hail that damages shingles, 100-degree heat that cracks cheap materials, and hurricane-season winds that test every fastener.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            The difference between a roof that lasts and one that fails early is materials and installation. We use impact-resistant shingles rated for Texas hail zones, standing seam metal roofing that lasts 40+ years, and tile systems engineered for extreme heat. Every roof we install in Pharr is built for the conditions right outside your door.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            And because Tekton also builds custom homes, pools, and handles full remodels, we understand how your roof connects to the rest of your home — insulation, ventilation, structural integrity. That complete-home expertise means a better, longer-lasting roof for your Pharr property.
