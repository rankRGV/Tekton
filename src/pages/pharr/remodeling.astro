  {
    question: "What remodeling services do you offer in Pharr?",
    answer:
      "We handle kitchen remodels, bathroom renovations, whole-home updates, room additions, and interior refreshes for Pharr homes. Whether it's modernizing an older home near Cage Blvd or upgrading builder-grade finishes in a newer property, we do it all — design through completion.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a bathroom remodel cost in Pharr, TX?",
    answer:
      "Bathroom remodels in Pharr typically range from $8,000 for a basic update (new tile, vanity, fixtures) to $30,000+ for a full master bathroom renovation with custom shower, freestanding tub, and premium finishes. We provide a detailed estimate after seeing your space — no guesswork.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are older Pharr homes worth remodeling or should we just move?",
    answer:
      "Many older Pharr homes — especially those near Cage Blvd and in established neighborhoods — have solid construction and great locations. A well-executed remodel costs significantly less than buying new and lets you stay in the neighborhood you know. With Pharr property values rising, remodeling is also a strong investment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remodel my Pharr kitchen without gutting it completely?",
    answer:
      "Yes — not every kitchen needs a full gut renovation. We offer phased approaches: new countertops and backsplash, cabinet refacing, updated appliances, or a combination. We'll evaluate your Pharr kitchen and recommend the scope that gets the biggest impact for your budget.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you pull permits for Pharr remodeling work?",
    answer:
      "Yes — we handle all City of Pharr permits for structural, electrical, and plumbing work. We also coordinate all inspections. Permits protect you as the homeowner and ensure the work is done to code. We never skip this step.",
  },

            Pharr Property Values Are Rising — Your Home Should Keep Pace
          </h2>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Pharr is in the middle of real growth. Adjacent to McAllen, connected to international commerce through the Pharr-Reynosa Bridge, and seeing new development across the city. Property values are climbing — and homeowners who invest in quality remodeling now are positioned to benefit the most.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Older Pharr homes along the Cage Blvd area have solid construction and generous lot sizes, but interiors that haven't been touched in decades. Dated kitchens, cramped bathrooms, and closed-off floor plans drag down both your daily experience and your property value. A strategic remodel changes both — a modern kitchen, an updated master bath, or an opened-up living space can transform how your home feels and what it's worth.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Because Tekton also builds custom homes from scratch, we bring a builder's understanding to every Pharr remodel. We know which walls are load-bearing, how to reroute plumbing efficiently, and how to maximize space in ways that typical remodelers can't — or won't — attempt.
