    question: "How close is Tekton to Pharr?",
    answer:
      "Our McAllen office is at 1720 W Maple Ave Suite 4 — literally minutes from Pharr. Pharr and McAllen share a border, so we can have a crew at your Pharr home faster than almost any other city we serve.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work in both old and new Pharr neighborhoods?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We work across all of Pharr — from the older homes near Cage Boulevard and Sugar Road that need roof replacements and remodels, to the newer construction near Jackson Road and the Pharr Town Center area that need pools and outdoor living spaces.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle storm damage claims for Pharr homeowners?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Pharr gets hit by the same hailstorms and hurricane-season weather as the rest of western Hidalgo County. We document damage, file insurance claims, meet with your adjuster on-site, and fight for the full payout you're owed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for home improvements in Pharr?",
    answer:
      "Most structural work, roofing, pool construction, and electrical/plumbing changes require permits in Pharr. We handle the entire permitting process through the City of Pharr — applications, inspections, and final sign-offs. You don't have to deal with city hall.",
  },

            Pharr is right next door to McAllen — literally minutes from our headquarters on Maple Ave. From the neighborhoods along Cage Boulevard and Sugar Road to the newer developments near Jackson Road and the Pharr Town Center area, we know this city well. Many of our crew members live here.

          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg mb-4">
            Pharr homeowners face the same brutal South Texas conditions as the rest of the metro — 100°+ summers, hailstorms that roll through western Hidalgo County, and hurricane-season winds. But Pharr also has a mix of older homes that need significant updates and newer construction that needs quality outdoor living spaces. We handle both.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text-muted text-lg">
            Roof replacement after storm damage, a custom pool for your backyard, a kitchen remodel that transforms how you live, or a custom home built on your lot — Tekton is the one contractor in Pharr that does it all. No subcontractor roulette. No finger-pointing. Just one team that gets it done.
